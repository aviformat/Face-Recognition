# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition using 68 facial points from pre-trained CNN model using dlib and detection using Haar cascade.
It has certain advantages over many common face Recognition software:
1.) Detects Liveliness, Through techniques like eye blinking and neck rotation it understands whether a person it is recognising is real or just a Photo of that person.
2.) detects and recognises a person from a large distance (eg. 5m tested till now)
